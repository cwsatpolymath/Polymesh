# Polymesh - The Polymath Blockchain

Polymesh is a blockchain for regulated securities and open finance.

# Testing Community

# Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Install required tools:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# Debug

## Environment

Install GDB for your distribution.

## Build

Binary should be built in *debug mode*, using `cargo build` without `--release` parameter:
```
$> cargo build
```

Test cases are built in *debug mode* by default.

## Using GDB

Using `rust-gdb` you will get more pretty printed values of different types than go directly with
`gdb`. The following example, start `gdb`, set a breakpoint and start it:

```
$> rust-gdb ./target/debug/polymesh

# Run

## Single node development chain

You can start a development chain with:

```bash
./target/release/polymesh --dev --pool-limit 100000 -d /tmp/pmesh-primary-node
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set:
`RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/polymesh --dev --pool-limit 100000 -d /tmp/pmesh-primary-node`.

To access the Polymesh Chain using the [Web Interface](https://app.polymesh.live/#/explorer) do the following:

1. In [Settings](https://app.polymesh.live/#/settings) tab under the `General` section select `Local Node (Own, 127.0.0.1:9944)` as remote endpoint.
2. If you have [custom types definitions](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/blob/master/polymesh_schema.json) that differ from the V1 Aldebaran Testnet, you can update these in [Settings](https://app.polymesh.live/#/settings) tab under the `Developer` section.
3. Reload the page.

## Multi-node local testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with testnet units.

```bash
cd scripts/cli
npm install
./run.sh
```

This uses pm2 to run a local three node network for demonstrate simple consensus.

To stop the chain you can use:  
```bash
./stop.sh
```
and to display log files you can use:  
```bash
./log.sh
```

## Aldebaran Public Testnet

Specifying no chain at the command line defaults to the Aldebaran Public Testnet (e.g. --chain aldebaran), so to run a node which connects to the Aldebaran Public Testnet, you can start your node with:

```bash
./target/release/polymesh --pool-limit 100000 -d /tmp/pmesh-primary-node
```

# Unit Tests

Unit tests are packaged with the Rust code. To run these, you can execute:

```bash
cargo test --package polymesh-runtime-common  --features default_identity
cargo test --package pallet-staking
cargo test --package pallet-balances
cargo test --package pallet-im-online
cargo test --package polymesh-primitives
cargo test --package pallet-pips-rpc
cargo test --package pallet-transaction-payment
```

# Initialise

You can seed the network with some identities, claims, signing keys and assets by running the functional test.

```bash
cd scripts/cli
node run test
```

See [README](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/Polymesh/tree/master/scripts/cli) for details.

# Benchmark

Polymesh runtime benchmarks can be run with a command that specifies the pallet and the name of the
extrinsic to be benchmarked, for example:

```bash
cargo run --release --features runtime-benchmarks -- \
    benchmark --pallet asset --extrinsic register_asset
```

Note that the CLI binary should be built in release mode and that the feature flag
`runtime-benchmarks` should be set to enable the CLI option `benchmark`.
